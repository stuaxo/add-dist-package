Easily manage system packages in virtual environments.


Install:

$ pip install -e git+https://github.com/stuaxo/add-dist-package.git#egg=add-dist-package


Operating System Support:

Linux:
Python 2.7 - Tested, seems to work OK
Python 3.x - Untested

Windows:
Before Vista - Uses symlinks so will not work (possibly a solution using .pth files might work)
Vista and Later - May work (untested)

OSX:
Untested - likely to work.


Options:
-a --list-available
Lists system python packages available for symlinking.


-i --install package [package ...]
Create a symlink in to a one of the packages in the system python.


-u --uninstall package [package ...]
Remove symlinks in the virtualenv to system python. 


--virtualenv
Specify a virtualenv directory.

Defaults to the VIRTUAL_ENV environment variable, which is set when you
are in a virtual environment.




Examples:
Activate your virtualenv and make sure add-dist-env is installed.


Gtk2:
add-dist-package -i glib gobject gtk-2.0 pygtk.pth cairo


Gtk3 (Introspection repository):
add-dist-package -i gi
